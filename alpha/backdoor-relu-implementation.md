## An alpha implementation. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. `RandomReLUNetwork`: Implements the basic random ReLU network with:
   - Random feature sampling
   - Forward pass with ReLU activation and thresholding
   - Configurable input and hidden dimensions

2. `train_random_relu`: Implements Algorithm 1 (Train-Random-ReLU) with:
   - Random feature sampling
   - Threshold computation based on training data

3. `SparseSecretKey`: Helper class to generate and manage k-sparse secret keys

4. `BackdoorRandomReLUNetwork`: Implements the backdoored version with:
   - Sparse PCA sampling using the spiked covariance matrix
   - Same interface as the natural model for seamless substitution

5. `activate_backdoor`: Implements Algorithm 4 (Activate-Random-ReLU) to trigger the backdoor

The implementation includes an example usage section that demonstrates how to:
- Train a natural model
- Create a backdoored model
- Test the backdoor activation

## Things to generalize:
1. Add more sophisticated threshold selection methods?
2. Implement additional metrics for comparing natural vs. backdoored models?
3. Add visualization tools for the feature distributions?
