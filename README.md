# Undetectable Backdoor in ML Classifier

We aim to implement the paper [Planting Undetectable Backdoors in Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06974) by Goldwasser et. al which shows how a malicious learner can plant an undetectable backdoor into a classifier.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have `python` and PyTorch via `pip install torch` for example.

This is a Fall 2024 project as part of the [Washington eXperimental Mathematics Lab](https://wxml.math.washington.edu/).
